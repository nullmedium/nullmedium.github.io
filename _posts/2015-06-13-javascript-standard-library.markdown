If JavaScript gets so much love these days, why is there still no standard library? Only an ever growing collection of different frameworks.ï»¿
And it looks to me that every group tries to create its own "better" framework. There doesn't seem to be an effort to create a standardized
library that is available in all JavaScript engines. This framework madness looks like a children's playground to me.

At least this is the impression I got when I ran a Google search for "JavaScript Standard Library".
