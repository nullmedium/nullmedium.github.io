During the time between jobs, I started to learn a new programming language. A language that is entirely different
to C++, where I have the most experience. I chose Erlang. Erlang is a functional programming language for soft-realtime systems.
Compared to other functional programming languages it is actually used in the real world and industry and not just inside 
academia.
