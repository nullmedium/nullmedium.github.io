Dipl.-Inf. (FH)
Jens Luedicke

I have 10+ years of professional experience in modern C++ software development and software architecture of distributed systems, which I successfully applied it in the areas of defense, medical technology and industry / mechanical engineering.

My interest in long-lasting, modern source code and pragmatic solutions are at the forefront of my work.
