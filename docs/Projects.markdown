Over the years I have hacked on some personal Open Source projects.

- Currently working on a iOS/Mac App (not yet published)

- [**libattributes**](https://github.com/nullmedium/libattributes)
C++ library to provide a named attributes interface to classes.

- A [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) Interpreter:
<https://github.com/nullmedium/erlang-brainfuck-interpreter>

- [erlang-examples](https://github.com/nullmedium/erlang-examples)

- [**Filer**](https://github.com/nullmedium/filer)
A graphical file manager, written in Perl/Gtk2.

- [**File::DirWalk**](https://github.com/nullmedium/File-DirWalk)
A Perl Module to traverse a directory tree and execute custom actions (callbacks)
on file, folders, etc. I used to host this module on CPAN, but looking after
reported test failures on obscure operating systems I had no access to, was a show stopper for me.

The sources are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nullmedium) profile.
